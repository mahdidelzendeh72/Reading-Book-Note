1-One difference between casting and converting is that converting rounds the double value 9.8
up to 10 instead of trimming the part after the decimal point.
--double g = 9.8;
--int h = ToInt32(g);>>>> 10
--int f=(int)g;>>>>9


2-One problem with the Parse method is that it gives errors if the string cannot be
converted.

3-You can also use methods of the System.Convert type to convert string values into other types;
however, like the Parse method, it gives an error if it cannot convert.
