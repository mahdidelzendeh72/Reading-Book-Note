• Debug is used to add logging that gets written during development.
• Trace is used to add logging that gets written during both development and runtime.

Good Practice: When running with the Debug configuration, both Debug and
Trace are active and will show their output in DEBUG CONSOLE. When
running with the Release configuration, only the Trace output is shown.
You can therefore use Debug.WriteLine calls liberally throughout your code,
knowing they will be stripped out automatically when you build the release
version of your application
------------------- Instrumenting with Debug and Trace ----------------
Console App: WriteLine method to provide output to the console or TERMINAL or DEBUG CONSOLE windoes.

Trace & debug Class: more flexibility in where they write out to.

---- tip: buffer anf flush ---------------

Any type that represents a file usually implements a buffer to improve performance.
Instead of writing immediately to the file, data is written to an in-memory buffer and
only once the buffer is full will it be written in one chunk to the file. This behavior can
be confusing while debugging because we do not immediately see the results! Enabling
AutoFlush means it calls the Flush method automatically after every write
