******************* number ********************************

Numbers are data that we want to perform an arithmetic calculation on, for example,
multiplying. A telephone number is not a number. To decide whether a variable should be
stored as a number or not, ask yourself whether you need to perform arithmetic operations
on the number or whether the number includes non-digit characters such as parentheses or
hyphens to format the number as (414) 555-1234. In this case, the number is a sequence of
characters, so it should be stored as a string.

Numbers can be natural numbers, such as 42, used for counting (also called whole numbers);
they can also be negative numbers, such as -42 (called integers); or, they can be real numbers,
such as 3.9 (with a fractional part), which are called single- or double-precision floating point
numbers in computing
*********************************************************
You might know that computers store everything as bits. The value of a bit is either 0 or 1. This
is called a binary number system. Humans use a decimal number system.
******************** int ***********************************
Computers can always exactly represent integers using the int type or one of its sibling types
such as long and short
*********************** float ******************************

************************************************

The double type is not guaranteed to be accurate because some numbers literally cannot
be represented as floating-point values.

As a rule of thumb, you should only use double when accuracy, especially when
comparing the equality of two numbers, is not important. An example of this may be
when you're measuring a person's height

The decimal type is accurate because it stores the number as a large integer and shifts the
decimal point. For example, 0.1 is stored as 1, with a note to shift the decimal point one place
to the left. 12.75 is stored as 1275, with a note to shift the decimal point two places to the left.


******************* tip *************************

Good Practice: Use int for whole numbers and double for real numbers that
will not be compared to other values. Use decimal for money, CAD drawings,
general engineering, and wherever the accuracy of a real number is important
