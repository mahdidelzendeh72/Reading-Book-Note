Tuples are an efficient way to combine two or more values
into a single unit


Naming the fields of a tuple
To access the fields of a tuple, the default names are Item1, Item2, and so on.
You can explicitly specify the field names.


Inferring tuple names
If you are constructing a tuple from another object, you can use a feature introduced in C# 7.1
called tuple name inference.



Deconstructing tuples
You can also deconstruct tuples into separate variables. The deconstructing declaration has the
same syntax as named field tuples, but without a named variable for the tuple, as shown in the
following code:
// store return value in a tuple variable with two fields
(string name, int age) tupleWithNamedFields = GetPerson();
// tupleWithNamedFields.name
// tupleWithNamedFields.age
// deconstruct return value into two separate variables
(string name, int age) = GetPerson();
// name
// age
