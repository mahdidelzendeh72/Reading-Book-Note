In C#, a verbatim string is created using a special symbol @.
 @ is known as a verbatim identifier.
 If a string contains @ as a prefix followed by double quotes,
 then compiler identifies that string as a verbatim string and compile that string.
 The main advantage of @ symbol is to tell the string constructor to ignore escape characters and line breaks.
 There is mainly three uses of @ symbol which is as follows:

 Use 1: Keyword as an Identifier This symbol allows using a keyword as 
        an identifier. The @ symbol prefixes the keyword, so the compiler takes keyword as
        an identifier without any error as shown in the below example:
        ------string[] @for = {"C#", "PHP", "Java", "Python"};
        ------var @var=124;


Use 2: For printing the escape sequences in string literals and also using the line breaks etc.
       in a string literal without any escape sequence. If one will put the escape sequence
       like “\\” (for backslash), “\u” (Unicode escape sequence), “\x” (hexadecimal escape sequence) etc.
       in a string literal without using @ symbol then these sequences will be interpreted by compiler automatically.
       But “” (double quotes) are not interpreted literally. Its like a string interpolation.
       Let’s see different cases with and without @ symbol.
