You can use the var keyword to declare local variables. The compiler will infer the type
from the value that you assign after the assignment operator, =.
A literal number without a decimal point is inferred as an int variable, that is, unless
you add the L suffix, in which case, it infers a long variable.
A literal number with a decimal point is inferred as double unless you add the M suffix,
in which case, it infers a decimal variable, or the F suffix, in which case, it infers a
float variable. Double quotes indicate a string variable, single quotes indicate a char
variable, and the true and false values infer a bool type.



implicity type must declear and initialize at the same type

--- var myvariable;===>>>  error
--- var myvariable=10;===>>>  true
