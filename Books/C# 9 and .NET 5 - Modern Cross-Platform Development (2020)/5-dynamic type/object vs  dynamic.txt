There is another special type named dynamic that can also store any type of data, but even
more than object, its flexibility comes at the cost of performance. The dynamic keyword was
introduced in C# 4.0. However, unlike object, the value stored in the variable can have its
members invoked without an explicit cast.

dynamic :   dont need cast to invoke member      runtime         bad performance    no IntelliSense
