What other patterns make use of the Hollywood Principle?

sort method in array how use templated method?

. For example, java.io has a
read() method in InputStream that subclasses must implement and is
used by the template method read(byte b[], int off, int len)


We know that we should favor composition over inheritance, right? Well, the
implementers of the sort() template method decided not to use inheritance and
instead to implement sort() as a static method that is composed with a Comparable
at runtime. How is this better? How is it worse? How would you approach this
problem? Do Java arrays make this particularly tricky?


Think of another pattern that is a specialization of the template method. In
this specialization, primitive operations are used to create and return objects.
What pattern is this?


hook in git???

The Strategy and Template
Method Patterns both encapsulate
algorithms, the first by composition
and the other by inheritance.


Âƒ Factory Method is a specialization
of Template Method
