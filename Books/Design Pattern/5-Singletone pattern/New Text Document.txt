1-singleton + multitread===> eager load vs lazy load 
2-singleton and class loader

3-And reflection, and serialization/
deserialization?
4-singletone and subclass????
5-singletone and enum????
6- q: I still don’t totally understand
why global variables are worse than a
Singleton.

A:In Java, global variables are basically
static references to objects. There are a
couple of disadvantages to using global
variables in this manner. We’ve already
mentioned one: the issue of lazy versus
eager instantiation. But we need to keep
in mind the intent of the pattern: to ensure
only one instance of a class exists and to
provide global access. A global variable can
provide the latter, but not the former. Global
variables also tend to encourage developers
to pollute the namespace with lots of global
references to small objects. Singletons don’t
encourage this in the same way, but can be
abused nonetheless
