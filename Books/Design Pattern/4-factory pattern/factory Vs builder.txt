Yes, there are differences between the Factory pattern and the Builder pattern. Although both patterns are creational design patterns, they serve different purposes.

The Factory pattern is used to create objects of a specific type, while the Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. Here are some key differences:

1. Object Creation: In the Factory pattern, the focus is on creating objects of a specific type. The factory class or method encapsulates the object creation logic and returns the created object. On the other hand, the Builder pattern focuses on constructing complex objects by step-by-step construction. The builder class provides methods to set different attributes or properties of the object being built.

2. Object Complexity: The Factory pattern is suitable for creating simple objects, where the creation process is straightforward. The Builder pattern is more suitable for creating complex objects that require multiple steps or configurations.

3. Object Representation: In the Factory pattern, the created object is returned immediately after creation, and the client code can start using it. In the Builder pattern, the object is constructed gradually, and the client code can access the partially constructed object at any point during the construction process.

4. Flexibility: The Factory pattern provides a way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client code. It allows for easy extension by adding new factory classes or methods for different types of objects. The Builder pattern provides more flexibility in constructing objects with different configurations or variations. It allows for the creation of different representations of the same object.

In summary, the Factory pattern focuses on creating objects of a specific type, while the Builder pattern focuses on constructing complex objects step by step, allowing for different configurations and variations.
