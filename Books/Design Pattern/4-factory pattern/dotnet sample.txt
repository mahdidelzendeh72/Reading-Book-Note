In the .NET framework, there are several places where the factory pattern is used internally. Here are a few examples:

System.Data.Common.DbProviderFactory: This abstract class is used to create instances of ADO.NET database provider-specific classes. Each database provider, such as SQL Server or Oracle, implements its own concrete factory class derived from DbProviderFactory. This allows the application to create database-specific objects without directly referencing the provider's assembly.

System.Net.WebRequest: The WebRequest class is an abstract class that represents a request to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The Create method of the WebRequest class is a factory method that returns an instance of a derived class based on the URI scheme. For example, calling WebRequest.Create("http://example.com") will return an instance of the HttpWebRequest class.

System.IO.File: The File class provides static methods for creating, copying, deleting, and manipulating files. The Create method of the File class is a factory method that returns a FileStream object for creating or opening a file. The specific type of FileStream returned depends on the FileMode and FileAccess parameters passed to the method.
