there are several libraries and frameworks in C# that provide built-in support for
 implementing the Decorator pattern. Here are a few examples:

.NET Framework's System.IO namespace: The System.IO namespace in the 
.NET Framework provides a set of classes that can be used to implement the Decorator
 pattern for stream operations. For example, the StreamReader and StreamWriter classes
 can be used to add additional functionalities to a basic Stream object.


ASP.NET Core Middleware: In ASP.NET Core, middleware components can be used to
 implement the Decorator pattern for handling HTTP requests and responses.
 Each middleware component can wrap the next component in the pipeline, adding
 additional functionalities or modifying the behavior.


Dependency Injection (DI) Containers: Many DI containers, such as Autofac, Unity,
 and Ninject, provide support for implementing the Decorator pattern. These containers
 allow you to register decorators for interfaces or classes, which are then automatically
 applied when resolving dependencies.


Logging Libraries: Logging libraries like Serilog, NLog, and log4net often provide decorators
 or wrappers that can be used to add logging functionality to existing classes or methods.


These are just a few examples, and there are many other libraries and frameworks that provide
 support for implementing the Decorator pattern in C#. It's always a good idea to explore the 
documentation and features of the specific library or framework you are using to see if they 
offer built-in support for decorators.
Additionally, you can also implement your own decorator classes or use the examples provided 
earlier to create decorators for your specific needs, even if a library doesn't explicitly provide decorator functionality.
